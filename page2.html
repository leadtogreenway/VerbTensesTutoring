<h3> Verb Tenses Tutorial (Cont.)</h3>


<p> So what are verb tenses in English? 
<br>Verbs come in three tenses: past, present, and future. 
<br>The past is used to describe things that have already happened (e.g., earlier in the day, yesterday, last week, three years ago).
<br>The present tense is used to describe things that are happening right now, or things that are continuous. 
<br>The future tense describes things that have yet to happen (e.g., later, tomorrow, next week, next year, three years from now).
